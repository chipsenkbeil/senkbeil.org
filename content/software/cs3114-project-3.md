The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate a basic understanding of
external sorting by implementing heapsort externally and was tested with
academically-provided data.

This project, for academic purposes, met all requirements with no issues in the
implementation. While I cannot guarantee the code is clean as all of these
projects were finished over the course of one/two days, the code itself appears
to be stable.
