The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate an understanding of vertex and
fragment shaders by using some reference code provided by the professor and
writing our own vertex and fragment shader code in two external files.

Aside from minor tweaks, the only code I wrote for this assignment was the
vertex and fragment shaders used to cause a slow ripple effect and map leaf
textures onto the base texture.
